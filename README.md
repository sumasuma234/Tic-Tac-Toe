#  Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Player vs Computer)

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using Python where the user plays against the computer. The user plays as `X` and the computer plays as `O`.


##  Features

- Console-based interactive interface
- Player vs Computer mode
- Randomized computer moves
- Detects wins, losses, and draws
- Input validation and error handling


##  How to Play

- The board has 9 positions numbered as follows:
  1 | 2 | 3 ---+---+--- 4 | 5 | 6 ---+---+--- 7 | 8 | 9
- Enter a number between **1 to 9** to place your `X` in that position.
- The computer will automatically make a move as `O`.
- The game ends when either the player or computer wins, or it's a draw.


##  Requirements

Python 3.x
No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules)


 ##  What I Learned

- Implementing game logic with Python
- Handling user input and errors
- Using lists and conditions for board state
- Basic AI using random choices for computer moves
